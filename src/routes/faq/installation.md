## Downloading

The latest release of Meteor can be downloaded from [here](https://meteorclient.com/download).  
*Disclaimer: If your antivirus flags Meteor as dangerous, it is probably because it is an executable (jar) file.  
If you have any concerns feel free to check the source code located within this repository.*

## Installing

### Prerequisites
To play Minecraft, you'll need to have the compatible version of the JRE (Java Runtime Environment).  
Usually Minecraft downloads it automatically, but if it doesn't, you should get it from [Adoptium](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases).  
The current version used by Minecraft 1.19.2 is v17.

### Unsafe cracked launchers
Avoid using closed source third-party launchers (`TLauncher` is a common example).  
Since nobody can look at the code, the developers could insert malicious code, that could potentilally harm your devices.  
We do not provide support to cracked users in any way, as they do not legally own the game.

### Minecraft Launcher
If you already have Fabric Loader installed, skip to step 4.

1. Download the [Fabric installer](https://fabricmc.net/use/) and run it.
2. Make sure 1.19.2 is selected, the path to your `.minecraft` folder is correct, and `create profile` is checked.
3. Click `Install` and then wait for the process to complete.

4. Download Meteor from [here](https://meteorclient.com/download) and drag the downloaded jar file into the mods folder.
5. Open the Minecraft Launcher and select the Fabric 1.19.2 profile.
6. Thats it, just click `Launch` to start up Meteor.

### PolyMC
If you already have PolyMC installed, skip to step 2.  
If you already have a PolyMC instance with Fabric Loader, skip to step 4.
