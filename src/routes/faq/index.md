## How do I install Meteor?
If you have encountered or used YouTube "tutorials" on how to install and use Meteor, please disregard them.
Many of them are incorrect or outdated and, as stated below, we do not support older versions.

For in-depth installation instructions, refer to the [installation guide](https://github.com/MeteorDevelopment/meteor-client/wiki/Installation).

## What are the dev builds and should I use them?
Dev builds (or otherwise known as betas, nightlies, etc) are available both on the [website](https://meteorclient.com/) and in the [discord server](https://meteorclient.com/discord)'s `#dev-builds` channel.
Dev builds are generally very stable and much preferable to use due them to having most recent fixes and features.
If unstable changes were do made in dev builds, they are usually made clear with warnings, for example: "Dont use".

## How do I use Meteor on older Minecraft versions?
Meteor is always kept up to date with the latest stable release of Minecraft.  
You can use [ViaFabric](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/viafabric) if you want to connect to servers running other versions of Minecraft.

## How do I open the GUI?
The default key for opening the GUI is <kbd>Right Shift</kbd> which you can change this via the Minecraft controls menu.
Inside the GUI, you can left click on a Module to toggle it and right click to configure its settings.

## How do I use the HUD?
- Go to the HUD tab (the top of the screen).
- Check the "Active" checkbox to enable it.
- Tweak any settings you would like and use the "Edit" button to access the HUD editor.

A red highlight on the hud element indicates that they are **OFF**. Simply left click to toggle and right click to configure.

## How do I import and export configs?
You can use Copy Paste shortcuts in the GUI to copy and paste configs.
- Windows and Linux: `Ctrl + C` and `Ctrl + V`
- MacOS: `Cmd + C` and `Cmd + V`

You can also use this feature in individual modules and individual tabs (GUI, Config, HUD, etc).

## Can I please get configs/settings?
We do not provide preset configs.
You may try asking in the Discord server's public channels but staff are not obliged to give any answers.

## How to use Meteor with Optifine?
Optifine is not and never will be supported by Meteor. We recommend using these instead:

- [Sodium](https://modrinth.com/mod/sodium) | Performance improvements (better than Optifine)
- [Lithium](https://modrinth.com/mod/lithium) | Server optimisations
- [Starlight](https://modrinth.com/mod/starlight) | Lighting engine improvements

More alternatives and the detailed reason optifine is not supported [here](https://lambdaurora.dev/optifine_alternatives/).

## How do I use Baritone with Meteor?
Meteor comes with Baritone built in, you don't need to download a standalone baritone.
Baritone's default command prefix is `#`.
You can view all of Baritone's commands [here](https://github.com/cabaletta/baritone/blob/master/USAGE.md) and settings [here](https://baritone.leijurv.com/baritone/api/Settings.html).

## How do I dupe with Meteor?
Finding dupes isn't an easy task. Public dupes get patched very quickly so a lot of dupes are kept private.
For this reason, Meteor has no built in duping modules/features.

## Why can't I talk in the Meteor Discord?
You may have broken one of the rules in the [#rules](https://discord.com/channels/689197705683140636/816501672477720626/) channel
and have been muted by staff.

If you did not break a rule, then [this](https://discord.com/channels/689197705683140636/689198722097348624/870066829622652989) might explain why.
Due to the amount of users in the discord server increasing, public channels have been closed to only users who have roles. You can get a role by creating an account [here](https://meteorclient.com/account).

## How to use the proxy system?
It works just like a normal socks proxy. If you don't know what a proxy is, then I suggest you [google it](https://letmegooglethat.com/?q=proxy) and find out.
